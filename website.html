        A lot of people around the world travel every year 
        to many places. Moreover, it is important to travel 
        to humans. Some travel to learn more while some 
        travel to take a break from their life. No matter 
        the reason, travelling opens a big door for us to 
        explore the world 
        beyond our imagination and indulge in many things.   
    </p>
    <b>
        Why do we travel?
        </b>
    <p>
        There are a lot of reasons to travel. Some people 
        travel for fun while some do it for education purposes.
         Similarly, others have business reasons to travel. 
         In order to travel, 
        one must first get an idea of their financial 
        situation and then proceed.

Understanding your own reality helps people make good 
travel decisions. If people gave enough opportunities 
to travel, they set out on the journey. People going 
on educational tours get a first-hand experience of 
everything theyâ€™ve read in the text.

 The culture, architecture,
 cuisine and more of the place can open our mind to new
  things.

  <b>
    The Benefits of Travelling
  </b>
  <p>
    There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it. The first one being, 
  <br> <b>we get to meet new people. When you meet new people, you get the opportunity to make new friends. 
    It may be a fellow traveller or the local you asked for directions.</b> 
<br>

<u>Moreover, new age technology has made it easier to keep in touch with them. Thus, it offers not only a 
    great way to understand human nature but also explore new places with those friends to make your trip easy.</u>
<br>
<i>Similar to this benefit, travelling makes it easier to understand people. You will learn how other 
    people eat, speak, live and more. When you get out of your comfort zone, you will become more sensitive 
    towards other cultures and the people.</i>
<br>
<em>Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills. When you go to hilly areas, 
    you will most likely trek and thus, trekking 
    will be a new skill added to your list.

    Similarly, scuba diving or more can also be learned while travelling.</em><br> <strong> Similarly, people who 
        travel for fun get to experience 
        and indulge in refreshing things which may serve as a 
        stress reducer in their lives.</strong> <br>
